# Xendit Payment Integration Research

## Key Findings

Xendit provides comprehensive payment APIs for Indonesian market with support for:

### Payment Methods:
- Virtual Accounts (VA) - Bank transfers
- Credit Cards
- E-wallets (OVO, GoPay, DANA, etc.)
- QRIS (Quick Response Code Indonesian Standard)
- Retail outlets (Alfamart, Indomaret, etc.)

### API Structure:
- RESTful API with predictable URLs
- Basic Authentication using API keys
- JSON responses for all endpoints
- Webhook support for real-time notifications

## Key API Endpoints

### 1. Payment Request API
```
POST /v3/payment_requests
```
- Creates payment requests for various channels
- Supports QRIS, VA, cards, e-wallets
- Returns payment URLs or account numbers

### 2. Payment Status
```
GET /v3/payment_requests/{payment_request_id}
```
- Check payment status
- Get payment details

### 3. Webhooks
- Real-time payment notifications
- Status updates (SUCCEEDED, FAILED, etc.)

## QRIS Implementation

QRIS is supported through the Payment Request API with:
- Channel code: "QRIS"
- Dynamic QR code generation
- Real-time payment processing
- Webhook notifications

## Virtual Account Implementation

VA is supported with:
- Multiple bank options (BCA, BNI, BRI, Mandiri, etc.)
- Unique account numbers per transaction
- Automatic payment detection
- Settlement within 1-2 business days

## Authentication

Uses Basic Auth with:
- API Key as username
- Empty password
- Base64 encoding
- HTTPS required

## Mock Implementation Strategy

For MVP, we will create mock implementations that:
1. Simulate Xendit API responses
2. Generate mock payment URLs/VA numbers
3. Handle webhook callbacks
4. Update transaction statuses

This allows full functionality testing without requiring actual Xendit account setup during development.
