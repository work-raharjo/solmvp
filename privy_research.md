# Privy KYC Integration Research

## Key Findings

Based on the research, there are two different Privy services:

1. **Privy.io** - US-based crypto wallet and authentication service
2. **Privy.id** - Indonesian digital signature and identity verification service

For Sol MVP, we need **Privy.id** (Indonesian service) as it provides:
- Digital identity verification for Indonesian market
- Document verification and OCR capabilities
- KYC services for Indonesian regulations

## Privy.id Capabilities

### API Suite Features:
- User Registration API with identity verification
- Document upload API with encryption
- Signature setup API for document templates
- Signing API for document processing
- Webhook support for notifications
- OAuth2 authentication

### Security & Compliance:
- Webtrust for Certification Authority (CA) accreditation
- ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certification
- 40 million verified users
- 2,600+ enterprise customers

## Implementation Strategy

Since specific passport verification API documentation is not publicly available, we will:

1. **Mock Implementation**: Create a mock Privy integration that simulates:
   - Passport OCR extraction
   - Selfie liveness detection
   - KYC status updates via webhooks

2. **API Structure**: Design the integration to match expected Privy.id patterns:
   - RESTful API calls
   - Webhook callbacks for status updates
   - Secure authentication with API keys

3. **Future Integration**: The mock implementation will be structured to easily replace with actual Privy.id API calls when access is obtained.

## Mock API Endpoints (for MVP)

POST /api/privy/kyc/initiate
{
  "user_id": "string",
  "passport_image": "base64_string",
  "selfie_image": "base64_string"
}
```

### Get KYC Status
```
GET /api/privy/kyc/status/{kyc_id}
```

### Webhook Callback
